# Kioptrix Level 1 Gain Root Using Metasploit


From our enumeration we came across exploits through searchcploit and googling that mostly pointed to a keyword called "trans2open".

Hence we start metasploit and search for the keyword "trans2open" and select the linux version of the exploit. For payload we go for a default payload which was a staged payload, however if that does not get us the shell we go for a non staged payload:

We set the available options for the exploit and payload and then go for the exploit.

WE have successfully rooted Kioptrix Level 1 box!


In the next blog we shall see how to exploit and gain access using manual methods! See you there!
