## Welcome to Vandana Racherla's TCM Courses GitHub Pages

I have tried to cover the practical aspects of the courses in these github pages.

You can navigate to the various courses here:
[Practical Ethical Hacking](https://github.com/vandanarach/TCM-Courses/raw/main/docs/PracticalEthicalHacking/index.html)

All credit for the content goes to The Cyber Mentor and I am just showcasing the work in the TCM courses in these github pages as part of my practice to learn ethical hacking.
